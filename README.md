# Cow Tag Recognition
Optical Character Recognition program to detect cow earring tag's

This was my first OCR project! I made it on April 2022, while studying image recognition on Python. 
I wanted to practice some of the concepts I was learning.

Please keep in mind this is a very basic approach. Also, this code needs a lot of cleaning!
